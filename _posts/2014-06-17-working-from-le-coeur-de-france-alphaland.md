<p>If you"re experiencing difficulty completing some tasks, working outside forces you to get job done because you are alone and free from distractions. </p>
<p>You"re in a nice place where nobody bothers you. So whenever you can"t get something done, just do the work in a different place. </p>
<p>Today, I"m working from Le Coeur De France Alphaland.</p>
<p>My meeting got cancelled so I decided to work on some back log tasks.  <a href="http://www.artdirect.org/">Here</a>  are some notes about the experience:</p>
<p>- The place is close to empty, early in the morning so you don"t get distracted.<br />
- The staff are friendly and helpful.<br />
- They offer some pastries on a two for the price of one promo.<br />
- The wifi is pretty good. Not the fastest in the world but enough to work with.<br />
- Ideal for writing, making calls, meetings.<br />
- They accept major credit cards. </p>
<p>I really like the place and expect to go here more often. The next time you have work to do consider going to Le Coeur De France Alphaland. </p>
<p>See you there.</p>
