I often find myself stuck on what to write on my blog. I have a lot of ideas on my notebooks and on my Simplenote App and Text files. I have hundreds and thousands of topics that haven't been published yet.

Everyday I learn from the geniuses. Everyday I learn something new. I'm embarrassed at the fact that I haven't been sharing enough to my readers.

In the past few days I was able to unstuck myself from a depression that hit me for five years. Today I'm totally free. What happened? The short of it is I got to read my blog and realized how awesome I was and how valuable my work is to other people. I was looking at the first few posts of minimal changes and saw the writing of the guy who would eventually have tens of thousands of visitors a month. I saw the attitude and that trickled back to the current version of myself. It's just like time travel.

This has been a lack of action and execution on my part. I benefit from reading my own blog. So can you. In fact instead of looking to outside sources on what to write for the next few weeks I'll just read my blog and write what's missing.

Here are the steps.

1. Look at your blog.
2. Read your blog.
3. What's missing?
4. What did I promise my readers that I haven't followed through on?
5. Do that.
6. Repeat the process over the next few weeks.
