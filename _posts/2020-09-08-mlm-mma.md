Business is like MMA.

MMA stands for Mixed Martial Arts.

You need to find prospects.

You need to get the prospects attention.

You need to present to prospects.

You need to sell to prospects.

You need to close deals.

You need to manage your resources.

You need to manage your schedule.

You need to follow up on your prospects.

You need to train your team.

You need to organize events.

You need to monitor and track productivity.

You need to eliminate time wasters.

You need to multiply output.

You need to be good at maintaining a large database of prospects and clients.

You need to be good at designing and optimizing your business process and daily routines.

You need to plan whole calendars instead of days.

You need to be good with numbers.

You need to be goood with negotiation.

You need to be good with delegation.

You may need to hire an assistant.

You may need to hire a driver.

You may need to hire a housekeeper.

What is MMA like?

You are allowed to punch.

You are allowed to kick.

You are allowed to use knees and elbows.

You are allowed to grapple.

You need cario.

You need strength training.

You need flexibility.

It's not just one discipline.

Both requires a lot of skills working together to achieve a bigger result.

If a person is saying it's easy, that person is likely lying to you.
