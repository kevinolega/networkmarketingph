Network marketing isn't an excuse to slack off.

Network marketing provides you with free time as a result of passive income generated by recurring sales from your customers combined with royalty commissions from sales teams that you haelped develop.

### Earning money while you sleep.

This trait is not.

If a person is lazy, nothing will change.

People who report enjoying free time are the people who built their gigantic sales organization.

We encounter stories of executives from multinational companies and top tier managers who quit their already high paying job to participate in network marketing full time.

These people are already incredibly effective and efficient at what they do.

These are the types of people that will do well in any job or business.

If you really want to get your finances in order, you want to insted, build up your discipline.
