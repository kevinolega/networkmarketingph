Faster, unfortunately means you have gained an increased forward mobility often at the cost of crashing more and failing more.

It's like jumping on a financial superbike. 

If it's your first time riding a motorcycle then going fast could kill you.

Top earners are often people with strong background with sales and marketing.

Not all job titles say it but getting to said position already requires that.

Their sales ability just gets downplayed in the presentation and training stories.

It requires good communication ability to excel at a task that involves dealing with other people.
