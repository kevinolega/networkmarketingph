What do you really want?

In a presentation, we are asked what we want in life...

- A nice house in a good neighborhood
- A fancy car
- A second car for coding
- Travel
- Education for Kids

Then the presenter asks how much all the images on the slide costs.

Depending on your standard of living, the amount will cost anywhere from 10 to 100 million pesos.

Problem is you can't afford this life with your job.

The question is, what do you really want?

Sometimes many of the images on the photos are "nice to haves" instead of things you really want.

For example:

If your goal is to travel around the world, you're likely not going to need to buy a car or a house.

If you decide to live in the big city and spend extra on your "home" you likely won't need a car or want to travel regularly.

If your goal is to master and practice a skill regularly all these vacations and doing something to "escape" won't be very appealing to you.

In a lot of situations, many of these pitches don't make sense unless you want to imitate fictional characters on TV.

Spend some time asking yourself, what are your real goals?

What's the most important thing to you?

Focus on accomplishing that.
